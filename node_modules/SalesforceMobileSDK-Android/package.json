Welcome! Starting with our 2.0 release, there are now two ways you can choose to work with the Mobile SDK:\n\n- If you'd like to work with the source code of the SDK itself, you've come to the right place! You can browse sample app source code and debug down through the layers to get a feel for how everything works under the covers. Read on for instructions on how to get started with the SDK in your development environment.\n- If you're just eager to start developing your own application, the quickest way is to use our npm binary distribution package, called [forcedroid](https://npmjs.org/package/forcedroid), which is hosted on [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/). Getting started is as simple as installing the npm package and launching your template app. You'll find more details on the forcedroid package page.\n\nInstallation (do this first - really)\n==\n\nAfter cloning the SalesforceMobileSDK-Android project from github, run the install script from the command line:\n\n`./install.sh`\n\nThis pulls submodule dependencies from github.\n\n(Windows users: run `cscript install.vbs` from the command line instead.)\n\nIntroduction\n==\n\n### What's New in 5.0\n\n**OS Version Support**\n- Android Nougat (API 25) is fully supported in Mobile SDK 5.0.\n\n**SmartStore Enhancements**\n- We have added new APIs that allow hybrid developers to create their own named databases.\n\n**SmartSync Enhancements**\n- We now allow sync down/refresh of data stored in soups by specifying the fields to sync.\n- smartsync.js now uses native promises instead of jQuery.\n\n**Hybrid Networking Enhancements**\n- We have replaced forcetk.mobilesdk.js with force.js. Networking in hybrid apps is now handled natively through a new plugin (com.salesforce.plugin.network). As a result, session token refresh happens automatically.\n\n**Library Upgrades**\n- We've updated React Native to version 0.35.0.\n- We've updated Cordova to version 6.1.0.\n- We've removed the dependency on Guava.\n\n**SalesforceAnalytics Library**\n- We've added a new library in Mobile SDK 5.0 called SalesforceAnalytics. This enables us to collect non-sensitive data on which features in Mobile SDK are being used. It is turned on by default, but can be turned off if required.\n\n**Other Technical Improvements**\n- We now support rich app templates (see [forcedroid](https://npmjs.org/package/forcedroid) for more details).\n- Improvements to sample apps.\n- Various bug fixes.\n\nCheck http://developer.force.com/mobilesdk for additional articles and tutorials.\n\n### Native Applications\nThe Salesforce Mobile SDK provides essential libraries for quickly building native mobile apps that seamlessly integrate with the Salesforce cloud architecture.  Out of the box, we provide an implementation of OAuth2, abstracting away the complexity of securely storing refresh tokens or fetching a new session ID when a session expires. The SDK also provides Java wrappers for the Salesforce REST API, making it easy to retrieve, store, and manipulate data.\n\n### Hybrid Applications\nHTML5 is quickly emerging as dominant technology for developing cross-platform mobile applications. While developers can create sophisticated apps with HTML5 and JavaScript, some limitations remain, specifically: session management, access to the camera and address book, and the inability to distribute apps inside public App Stores. The Salesforce Mobile Container makes possible to combine the ease of web app development with power of the Android platform by wrapping a web app inside a thin native container, producing a hybrid application.\n\n### WARNING: OAuth2 token storage on devices without encryption\nThe Salesforce Mobile SDK provides PIN-based OAuth token encryption for Android devices that don't provide full storage encryption functionality.  The SDK implementation is **NOT** designed to provide complete security. It's simply offered as an option for temporarily protecting your app from eavesdroppers. Please use caution in your production deployment with sensitive data. **We strongly recommend deploying production apps on the latest generation of Android devices with build-in device encryption.**\n\nSetting up your Development Environment\n==\n\nThe following steps will help you get started with your development environment, whether you choose to develop native apps or hybrid apps. See the `README` files in the `native/` and `hybrid/` folders for additional notes pertaining to development in those environments.\n\n1. Install the Android SDK and Android Studio: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\n2. Get setup on github: http://help.github.com/\n\nDownloading the Salesforce SDK\n==\n\nTo pull down the SDK from github, create a new directory and git clone the salesforce SDK repo.\n<pre>\ngit clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android.git\n</pre>\n\nDocumentation\n==\n\n* [SalesforceSDK](http://forcedotcom.github.com/SalesforceMobileSDK-Android/index.html)\n* [Mobile SDK Development Guide](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-Shared/blob/master/doc/mobile_sdk.pdf)\n\nDiscussion\n==\n\nIf you would like to make suggestions, have questions, or encounter any issues, we'd love to hear from you.  Post any feedback you have on our [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/114225252149514546445).\n",
